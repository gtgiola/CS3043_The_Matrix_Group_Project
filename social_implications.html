			<h2>Social Implications of Computing Topics</h2>
			
			<h3>Networked Communications</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The Matrix itself is basically a large network of human computers.
				<li>Censorship - humans inside the Matrix are completely unaware that the real world exists. They know only what the Matrix would lead them to believe
				<li>Sting Operations - as with law enforcement remaining covert in chatrooms, agents manifest from regular people when they identify and commit to their target.
				<li>Internet Addiction - With internet addiction, people spend as much time as possible within their virtual space (despite its consquences in the long-term). Knowing full well that he is causing the deaths of everyone he knows and surrendering himself to the machines, Cypher wants more than anything to return to the Matrix.
			</ul><br>

			<h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The codes to Zion are equivalent to a trade secret. Use and protection of these codes gives the humans an advantage against the machines.
			</ul><br>

			<h3>Information Privacy</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Information privacy is constantly threatened in the Matrix by both humans and machines:
					<ul>
						<li>Agents keep trying to “steal” (gain access to) the codes to Zion
						<li>Neo is a Hacker, even before joining Morpheus and the other rebels.
						<li>Wiretapping: Phone calls are tracked
						<li>Privacy and Trust - The privacy that Cypher enjoys in his activities allows him to build a reputation that does not match his true intentions.
						<ul>
							<li>Cypher decides he’s had enough and betrays his leader in exchange for being reabsorbed into the Matrix with his memory of reality erased and a new virtual life as a wealthy actor. “After nine years, do you know what I realize?” he tells one of the agents. “Ignorance is bliss.”<sup>1</sup>
						</ul>
						<li>Opt-in/Opt-out - The Matrix uses an extreme opt-out policy where you must be physically disconnected from it to prevent it access to your information (the red pill).
					</ul>
			</ul><br>
			<h3>Privacy and the Government</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The “government” (agents) threatens humans’ rights to privacy:
					<ul>
						<li>Constant surveillance:
							<ul>
								<li>When Neo is interrogated, the agents show him and file full of information about him, which suggests that people are in constant surveillance.
								<li>Agents tend to appear nearby when there is suspicious activity happening in the Matrix
							</ul>
						<li>When Neo is “captured” by the agents, a tracking chip (“bug”) is inserted in his body in order to monitor his movements from that point on.
						<li>Wiretapping: Phone calls are tracked
						<li>Abuse of power to gain access to information (Invasive Government Actions):
							<ul>
								<li>Morpheus’ and Neo’s interrogations
								<li>Trying to force “the rebels” to reveal the codes to Zion
							</ul>
					</ul>
			</ul><br>

			<h3>Computer and Network Security<sup>2</sup></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Throughout the movie, there is constant evidence of how the rebels attempt to ensure the security of their communications:
					<ul>
						<li>Communications between Tank and the crew
						<li>Transportation through phone lines
					</ul>
				<li>However, there is also evidence of both machines and humans threatening the security of computer and network communications in the Matrix:
					<ul>
						<li>Neo is a hacker (again)
						<li>The red pill is a program that disrupts a person’s connection to the matrix; disrupting the network.
						<li>When entering the matrix, Morpheus and his crew are essentially a cyber attack
							<ul>
								<li>They would like to see the agents destroyed, and all humans freed
							</ul>
						<li>Machines cause disruptions in their own system with the agents.
							<ul>
								<li>They take the place of an existing entity within the Matrix, without creating a replacement for them.
							</ul>
						<li>Both sides of the conflict seem to have displayed some moral blindness.
							<ul>
								<li>The humans, in using and destroying
								<li>The machines, in their subjection of the humans. Agents inhabiting the bodies of their hosts.
							</ul>
					</ul>
			</ul><br>
			<h3>Computer Reliability</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Simulations are used to guarantee reliability.
					<ul>
						<li>They trained and tested Neo within the Construct (their own Matrix simulation)
					</ul>
				<li>Throughout the movie, there factors that compromise the reliability of the Matrix:
				<ul>
					<li>Glitches (Deja vu) - a small recurrence when something inside the Matrix changes
					<li>The first Matrix attempted to make a utopia, but no human would accept the programming
						<ul>
							<li>“Entire crops were lost.” The system failed.
						</ul>
					<li>“The One” being able to defy the rules of the matrix.
				</ul>
			</ul><br>
			<h3>Work and Wealth</h3><br>
