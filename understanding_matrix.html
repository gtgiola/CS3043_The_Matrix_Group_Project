				Understanding the Matrix

			<h3>
				Perception of Reality:
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The idea of The Matrix can be connected to Plato’s Allegory of the Cave: “the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus confined to false perception” <sup>1</sup>
				</li>
				<li>
					The idea of AI depicted in The Matrix is an example of Descartes’ First Meditation hypothesis: “the perceived world might be an illusion created to deceive us.” <sup>2</sup>
				</li>
				<li>
					Morpheus: “What is real? How do you define real?”...“If you’re talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.” <sup>3</sup>
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Senses have been known to lie, since when we’re dreaming we often do not realize that we are dreaming</li>
					<li>Therefore, it’s easy to mistakenly consider an “unreal” experience as a real one</li>
					<li>The ordinary sensory evidence we rely on to tell us what is true cannot necessarily be trusted.</li>
					<li>Can we really be sure that any of it is authentic?</li>
				</ul>
				<li>
					The rebels seem to be sure that agents are simply machines that have taken control of the world and need to be destroyed. <sup>4</sup>
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Machines are not expected to have no emotional feelings</li>
					<ul>
						<li>However, we can see in the movie how at critical points agents (Smith in particular) do display emotions (e.g. anger, fear, and surprise).</li>

							<ul>
								<li>They also seem able to plan and to carry out plans.</li>
								<li>Smith also displays sadistic pleasure</li>
								<ul>
									<li>when he forces Neo’s mouth shut during the interrogation.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Smith also displays extreme fear near the end of the movie</li>
								<ul>
									<li>when Neo leaps through him</li>
								</ul>
							</ul>
							<li>The agents display many, if not all, of the responses we associate with consciousness.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>So, how can we be sure they do or do not posses minds like humans?</li>
							</ul>

			<h3>Fate vs. Free Will: <sup>4,5</sup></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					When Morpheus asks Neo to choose between a red pill and a blue pill, he essentially offers the choice between fate and free will.
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li>In the Matrix, fate rules:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>the world is preconstructed</li>
						<li>actions predetermined</li>
						<li>all questions already have answers</li>
						<li>any choice is simply the illusion of choice.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>In the real world, humans have the power to:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>change their fate</li>
						<li>take individual action</li>
						<li>make mistakes</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<li>
					Are Neo’s actions an example of free will?
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Neo relies on the Oracle, and everything she says comes true in some way.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Tells Neo what he needs to hear.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>If the Oracle can see around time and guide Neo to the right decision at each encounter, he doesn’t have to exhibit much, if any, free will.</li>
					<li>The Oracle is always right, raising doubts about how much free will Neo actually has.</li>
					<li>The Oracle only predicts events within the Matrix</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
