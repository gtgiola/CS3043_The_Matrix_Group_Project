				Perception of Reality:

			<ul>
				<li>
					The idea of The Matrix can be connected to Plato’s Allegory of the Cave: “the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus confined to false perception”

					The idea of AI depicted in The Matrix is an example of Descartes’ First Meditation hypothesis: “the perceived world might be an illusion created to deceive us.”

				<li>
					Morpheus: “What is real? How do you define real?”...“If you’re talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.”
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Senses have been known to lie, since when we’re dreaming we often do not realize that we are dreaming
					</li>
					<li>
						Therefore, it’s easy to mistakenly consider an “unreal” experience as a real one
					</li>
					<li>
						The ordinary sensory evidence we rely on to tell us what is true cannot necessarily be trusted.
					</li>
					<li>
						Can we really be sure that any of it is authentic?
